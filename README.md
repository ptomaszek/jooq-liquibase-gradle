## jOOQ code generation from SQL files with Kotlin Gradle

#### Setup:

- Kotlin Gradle (`build.gradle.kts`)
- [nu.studer.jooq](https://github.com/etiennestuder/gradle-jooq-plugin) plugin
- Liquibase changelogs in SQL (could be Flyway's - shouldn't matter as far as it's plain SQL)
- To keep things simple Liquibase is not configured to be actually run against any DB

#### Build

1. `./gradlew build`
1. Open `com.github.ptomaszek.db.Dao` which references code generated by jOOQ from SQLs
